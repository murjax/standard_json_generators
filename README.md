# Standard JSON Generators

This is a custom collection of Rails generators for my applications. They utilize
a JSON schema file for reading columns and other configurations. The project
exists as an extremely minimal Rails application. Generators can use a target
directory config to copy files to their destination projects.

### Included Generators
`json` - A full CRUD generator. Includes models, migrations, controllers, views, cypress tests.
